"""Minimal local RTSP/RTP server for go2rtc.

Serves H.264 + G.711 PCMA over RTSP so that go2rtc (bundled in Home
Assistant) can relay the stream to the browser via WebRTC.

Supports multiple simultaneous clients (go2rtc + HA stream worker both
connect to stream_source() at the same time).  Feed tasks run from start()
to stop() and broadcast RTP to every registered client independently —
no client can steal another's data.

Transport modes:
  - TCP interleaving (RTP/AVP/TCP) — default for go2rtc and FFmpeg
  - UDP unicast (RTP/AVP) — fallback (single client)

Protocol flow (RFC 2326):
    client → OPTIONS  → 200 OK
    client → DESCRIBE → 200 OK + SDP (video H.264 PT96 + audio PCMA PT8)
    client → SETUP video → 200 OK
    client → SETUP audio → 200 OK
    client → PLAY       → 200 OK  [client registered, starts receiving RTP]
    [server broadcasts RTP until TEARDOWN or disconnect]

TCP interleaved RTP (RFC 2326 §10.12):
    $ | channel (1 byte) | length (2 bytes BE) | RTP packet

Audio keepalive:
    When no real audio is available, silent PCMA (0xD5) is sent every ~1s
    so go2rtc and the stream worker stay connected between calls.
